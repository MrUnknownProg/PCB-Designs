# PCB-Designs

Welcome to the **PCB-Designs** repository! This repository contains a collection of hardware design projects, including PCB layouts, schematics, and related resources. The goal of this repo is to provide open-source reference designs and demonstration projects for various electronics applications.


## Getting Started

1. **Browse Designs**: Each project is organized under its own folder.
2. **Design Files**: Inside each project folder, you may find schematic files, board layouts, BOMs, and documentation.
3. **Usage**: You can use the designs as reference or as a base for your own hardware projects. Please review each projectâ€™s files and documentation for specific usage instructions.

## Projects Included

- **FOTA**: Design files for implementing Firmware Over-The-Air updates in embedded systems using ESP32 Wroom.
- **OTTOVOX Robot**: Electronics for a robotics project named OTTOVOX, includs both control and sensor boards.
- **Servo Testor**: Utility hardware to test and characterize servo motors.
